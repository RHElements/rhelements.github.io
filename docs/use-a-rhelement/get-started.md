# Use a RHElement

## Get Started

How you consume a RHElement depends on your environment, application framework,
and your browser support requirements. With that in mind, RHElements are built
and shipped so they're usable in a lot of different contexts. We want to be
forward thinking so we provide an ES6 version that we believe will be the
standard way RHElements will be consumed in the future. But if you can't use
ES6 today, we also ship an ES5 version that can even support IE11.
