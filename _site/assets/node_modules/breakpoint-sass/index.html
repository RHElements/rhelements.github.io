<p><strong>Really Simple Media Queries with Sass</strong></p>

<p>Breakpoint makes writing media queries in Sass super simple. Create a variable using a simplified syntax based on most commonly used media queries, then call it using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">breakpoint</code> mixin.  Breakpoint handles all of the heavy lifting, from writing the media query itself, to handling cross-browser compatibility issues, so you can focus on what’s important: making sure your website looks its best.</p>

<p>Breakpoint also allows you to get the <a href="https://github.com/Team-Sass/breakpoint/wiki/Breakpoint-Context">context of your media queries</a> from your code, allowing you to write dynamic mixins based on their media query context.</p>

<p>If you’d prefer the semantic awesomeness of string names to identify your queries as opposed to variables, or want to dynamically generate media queries, the <a href="https://github.com/Team-Sass/breakpoint/wiki/Respond-To">Respond-To</a> syntax is now included in Breakpoint core!</p>

<p><strong>It is important to note</strong> that due to limitations within the Sass language itself, which themselves stem from some potentially unexpected cascading from doing so, Breakpoint is unable to concat like media queries into a single media query. This means they will be spread out throughout your CSS. This is unfortunate, yes, but currently unavoidable. That being said, once <a href="https://github.com/nex3/sass/issues/241">Sass Issue #241: Seperate Media/Browser Specific Markup to Separate Style Sheet</a> hits, be sure we’re going to take full advantage of it.</p>
