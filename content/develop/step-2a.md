# Create a RHElement: Step 2a

## Develop a Structure

Run the dev command found in the package.json file at the root of your element to start watching for changes to any files located in the `/src` directory. This will build rh-cool-element.js and rh-cool-element.umd.js whenever you save changes.

```
# from the root of your element
npm run dev
```

After running the dev command, start a server at the root of the RHElements repository to view it in the browser.

```
# from the root of the RHElements repository
npm start
```

This will start a simple HTTP server that reloads the browser as you update your element.

![npm start command]({{ "assets/images/rh-cool-element-start.png" | relative_url }}){:width="500px"}

Navigate to `http://localhost:1234/elements/rh-cool-element/demo/` to view your element.

You're off to a good start! You have a new custom element that extends the base RHElement class, uses shadow DOM, and has a built-in fallback for ShadyCSS in case shadow DOM isn't supported.

Let's take a look at the rh-cool-element.js file in the `/src` directory to see what we have.

```
import RHElement from "../rhelement/rhelement.js";

class RhCoolElement extends RHElement {
  static get tag() {
    return "rh-cool-element";
  }

  get templateUrl() {
    return "rh-cool-element.html";
  }

  get styleUrl() {
    return "rh-cool-element.scss";
  }

  constructor() {
    super(RhCoolElement.tag);
  }
}

RHElement.create(RhCoolElement);
```

First, notice how we're using ES6 module imports and that we import the RHElement base element.
```
import RHElement from '../rhelement/rhelement.js';
```

Second, we define the string for the HTML tag that we want to use.

```
static get tag() {
  return "rh-cool-element";
}
```

Third, we reference where the HTML for our template and Sass styles are located.

```
get templateUrl() {
  return "rh-cool-element.html";
}

get styleUrl() {
  return "rh-cool-element.scss";
}
```

The gulp merge task in gulpfile.js fills this section with the compiled and transpiled files when you edit a file in the `/src` directory.

Fourth, you'll see the constructor for the element.

```
constructor() {
  super(RhCoolElement.tag);
}
```

The RHElement base element creates a shadow root to handle the ShadyCSS work for browsers that don't support shadow DOM.

Finally, we register our element using the `create` method from the RHElement class. This method calls `window.customElements.define`.

```
RHElement.create(RhCoolElement);
```

Now that our dev server is running and we have our element's structure, let's make it actually do something.
